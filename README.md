# Social Network API Challenge

This code includes the back-end API routes for a social networking application. With this code, one could create a User, as well as delete and update a user. The Users, once created, can be retrieved via GET request, either in a bulk list, or individually (by ID). Additionally, one could create Thoughts (think comments) which can be attributed to created Users. Once the Thoughts are posted, they too can be updated or deleted. I'm still troubleshooting the code, once finallized one will be able to post reactions to individual Thoughts, and also add individual Users to the friends lists of other Users.
Currently, the routes for Users is there and works as intended, but I still need to work out the bugs for GET and PUT requests for Thoughts, as well as the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests for Thoughts and Friends.

# Walkthrough Video

![Here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/u2pP33mvcdxPa6hNfOix) is the walkthrough video for this application. I wasn't able to get full functionality, as previously stated, but I'd already spent too long stuck on this project and wanted to at least post what I could. In future updates, this application will function fully and an updated walkthrough video will be included.
